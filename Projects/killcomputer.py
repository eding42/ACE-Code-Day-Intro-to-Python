# Kill Your Computer (tm):
# This program uses a while loop to freeze your
# computer.
#
# How It Works:
#   Basically, the "while (condition)" loop runs while a condition is true.
#   We exploit this fact by setting the condition to True.
#   Since True is always true (who would've guessed?) the loop runs until the end of time!
#   When run through a low performance platform like repl.it, you end up with frozen tab.
#
# Use Ctrl + C to exit out of the infinite loop (which for some reason doesn't actually work for Pycharm)
#
# Create a while true loop to destroy your computer (but only if it's slow, or a Chromebook)

while True:
    print("Infinite Loop")

# "It's that easy!"
