# ACE Code Day | Intro to Python
Where we'll keep all of our projects and teaching materials for the Intro to Python course in ACE Code Day. Hopefully. 

Installation:

`sudo apt install python3`

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt upgrade`

Run a Python script with:

`python3 nameofscript.py`

Replace "nameofscript.py" with the actual file name.

Or you could just copy the contents of the file into repl.it
