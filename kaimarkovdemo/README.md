# KaiCNN: Kai as a CNN

Kai says some really random things sometimes. TextRCNN also says random things sometimes. Therefore, we can replace Kai with a CNN.

Well, that was the original plan anyway. We still intend to make a CNN-powered network that can offer better generated sentences; for now, this project is a simple Markov chain generator powered by a dataset of Kai's slack messages.

# Running

Just run `markov.py`.
