# We'll be exploring the input function, or input()
# The input function allows for command line level interaction with the user.
# This sets the string firstinput as whatever you decide to enter.
firstinput = input("Here! Look! I'm asking you for a input: ")

# This prints whatever you entered in the first line
print("Your input was '{}'!" .format(firstinput))
