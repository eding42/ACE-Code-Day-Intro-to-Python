# Kill Your Computer (tm):
# This program uses a while loop to freeze your
# computer.
#
# How It Works:
#   Basically, the "while (condition)" loop runs while a condition is true.
#   We exploit this fact by setting the condition to True.
#   Since True is always true (who would've guessed?) the loop runs forever.

# Create a while true loop to destroy your computer
while True:
    print("Kill me please")
